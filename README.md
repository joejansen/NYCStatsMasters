# Intro

This is the code accompanying adam hogan's slides for [NYC Stats Programming Master Classes](http://www.meetup.com/datascienceclasses/events/148089802/) on November 6, 2013, 
titled "Beginner R with Adam Hogan"

The following files are represented:

* walkthrough.R
* arima.R # bonus file
* ttest.R # bonus f
* monthly-new-york-city-births.csv
* plots/ 
* GOOG.RData
* unrulypassengers.RData

## walkthrough.R

Contains an R terminal session of all the code that appears on the screen, so you can
copy and paste to follow along.

## arima.R, ttest.R

These are modified versions of some code from a talk I gave a [couple weeks ago](https://github.com/mittenchops/hackNYmasters).
If you found the basic plotting we covered in this session interesting, take a look at arima.R.  There's code in there
that shows how to use ggplot to make some really spiffy confidence bounds.  This incorporates opts() control, axis management,
and a couple of different kinds of objects added to the plot---if you understand how to make a graphic like this, you're
in really good shape!

## monthly-new-york-city-births.csv

This comes from the time-series data library and is used to illustrate arima plotting.

## plots

These are roughly the same plots used in the presentation you can compare against.
